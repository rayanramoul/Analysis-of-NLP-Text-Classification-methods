# Technical Assigngment
For this assignement i used a jupyter notebook because it was more interesting in terms of data analysis pipeline and visualization.

## Setup the project :
```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
source environment/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install jupyter
ipython kernel install --name "local-venv" --user
```

Also download the dataset (.csv) file here :

And the Google Word2Vec here : ( then extract it in the same root directory of the notebook ) :

## Execution :
```bash
jupyter lab
```
Then open from the lab the notebook and select the kernel with the name you tagged :)
